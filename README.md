This is a Robot that Punches you every time you get hit in Wii Sports

It’s an ai that reads the screen and constantly classifies the image passed through a virtual camera as a safe “class” and a “hit”. When the AI reads that the player was it in the game, it triggers a pneumatic cylinder to punch the player in real life (Video of the project below)

You run the main.py that reads from the keras model which triggers the arduino
